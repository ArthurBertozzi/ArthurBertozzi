### 📚 What I'm Learning

I'm always exploring new areas of development to expand my skill set. Currently, I'm delving into **game development**:

- **Unity**: Learning the fundamentals of game design, C# scripting, and creating 2D/3D games.
- **Unreal Engine**: Experimenting with Blueprints and C++ to create immersive gaming experiences.

I believe that the skills gained from game development, such as optimization, graphics programming, and complex system design, are transferable to various areas of software engineering.
